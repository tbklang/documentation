Overview
========

The `Parser` class contains several methods for parsing different sub-structures of a TLang program and returning different data types generated by these methods. The parser has the ability to move back and forth between the token stream provided and fetch the current token (along with analysing it to return the type of symbol the token represents - known as the `SymbolType` (TODO: Cite the â€œSymbol types" section).

For example, the method `parseIf()` is used to parse if statements, it is called on the occurence of the token of `if`. This method returns an instance of type `IfStatement`. Then there are methods like `parseBody()` which is responsible for creating several sub-calls to methods such as `parseIf()` and building up a list of `Statement` instances (the top-type for all parser nodes).

The entry point to call is `parse()` which will return an instance of type `Module`.
