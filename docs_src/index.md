# Tristan Programming Language

The Tristan programming language is a systems programming language for the modern day that aims to achieve the following goals:

1. To be efficient in the generated code
2. Cross-platform support
3. A _"C"_ with classes that isn't bloated like C++
4. Weakly typed (unsafe) type system
5. To put all the control in the hands of the user
	* Memory layout
	* Argument passing
	* _And more..._

Welcome to the official homepage for the Tristan programming language project.
