This is the very first release of the Tristan Language Project (_TLP_ for short) compiler and is therefore quite a historical moment for me in my life and those who have been involved in the project near the last few months prior to this release. I would therefore like to thank the following people:

1. TODO: List people
2. Wilhelm
    * Your help with the making this project ready for release to the world was something I am very greatful for, without it this project would have been in a state that would only allow for me and nobody else to work on it, your continued efforts to neaten things up, make the documentation more thurrough and filled-out is immensely appreciated
