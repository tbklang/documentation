\chapter{Why in the lords name are you doing this?}

Despite my eagerness to jump directly into the subject matter at hand
I think believe there is something of even greater importance. Despite
there being a myriad of reasons I embarked upon this project something
more important than the stock-and-standard ``I needed it to solve
a problem of mine'' reasoning comes to mind. There is indeed a better
reason for embarking on something that the mere \emph{technical requirement}
thereof - I did this \textbf{because I can}. This sentiment is something
that I really hold dear to my heart despite it being a seemingly obvious
one. Of course you can do what you want with your code - it's a free
country. One would not be wrong to make such a statement but mention
your ideas online and you get hounded down by others saying ``that's
dumb, just use X'' or ``your implementation will be inefficient''.
These statements are not entirely untrue but they miss the point that
this is an exercise in scientific thinking and an artistic approach
at it in that as well.\\

I would not want to see the naysayers put anyone down from doing something
they have always dreamed of, that is why I have done this. I am aware
of the risks and the downfalls of having grandeause expectations but
luckily I do not require the external feedback of the mass - just
some close few friends who can appreciate my work and join the endeavor
with me.\\
