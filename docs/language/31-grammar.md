## Grammar

The grammar for the language is still a work in progress and may take
some time to become concrete but every now and then I update this page
to add more to it or fix any incongruencies with the parserâ€™s actual
implementation. The grammar starts from the simplest building blocks and
then progresses to the more complex (heavily composed) ones and these
are placed into sections whereby they are related.

**TODO:** Finish implementing this

### Comments

These are the basic types of comments supported.

    (* TODO: I need to define all symbols as well so we can get this right *)
    (* As I don't like the ?-based special sequence *)
    singleComment  ::= "//", { anything };

    anything       ::= ? all ASCII characters excluding newline ?

### Literals

These make are the basic atoms that define literals.

    letter     ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K"
                | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V"
                | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g"
                | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r"
                | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z";

    digit      ::= ("0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9")

    number     ::= digit {(digit | underscore)} ["." digit {(digit | underscore)}] [encoder]

    encoder    ::= "S" | "B" | "W" | "I" | "L" | "UB" | "UW" | "UI" | "UL" | "SB"
                  "SW" | "SI" | "SL";

    underscore ::= "_"

### Expressions

Expressions come in many forms and are defined here.

    expr      ::= literal | binop | unaryop | parens | ident;

    literal   ::= number | float;

    ident     ::= letter | { letter, number };

    parens    ::= "(", expr, ")";

    infix     ::= "+" | "-" | "*" | "-";
    prefix    ::= "*" | "&";
    binop     ::= expr, operator, expr;
    unaryop   ::= prefix, operator;

    exprList  ::= [expr] | (expr, {",", expr});

    funccall  ::= ident, "(", exprList, ")";

**TODO:** Add `|`, `&` (infix), `&&` and `||` operators support first
before adding them here

### Statements

Statements are inevitably the building blocks of a program and make use
of all the former defined sections of the grammar and more of themselves
in some cases as well.

    module    ::= "module", ident, ";", {decl, ";"};
    decl      ::= vdecl | funcDecl;



    statement ::= discard | vdecl;



    comment   ::= singleComment | multiComment;



    discard   ::= "discard", expr, ";";


    vdecl     ::= type, identifier, [assign], ";";
    type      ::= "int" | "uint" | ident | ptrType;
    ptrType   ::= type, "*";
    assign    ::= "=", expr;


    parmList  ::= [type, ident] | {(type, ident), ","};
    funcdecl  ::= type, identifier, "(", parmList, ")", "{", {statement, ";"}, "}";


    if        ::= "if", "(", expr, ")", "{", { statement }, "}",
                 [ { "else", if } | ( "else", "{", { statement, ";" }, "}") ];

    while     ::= "while", "(", expr, ")", "{", { statement, ";" }, "}";

    (* TODO: Check if the below is correct actually *)
    for       ::= "for", "(", statement, ";", expr, ";", statement, ")", "{", {statement, ";"}, "}";
