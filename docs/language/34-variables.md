## Variables

Variables are the basic building blocks of a program. They are effcetively a storage container for data of a certain [type](types.md). More complex types are built out of a combination of such variables.

### Declaring variables

Declaring variables is very simple and follows the following format:

```
<type> <identifier;
```

You can also assign to a variable whilst declaring it:

```
<type> <identifier> = <expression of <type>>;
```

### Usage
You can update the stored value in a variable as so:

```
<identifier> = <expression of <type>>;
```
