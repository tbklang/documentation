### String literals

TODO: Add this

By default the encoding of characters is done by assuming UTF-8, meaning
that when you use `"ABBA"` it will encode to a byte array of
`[65, 66, 66, 65]`.

You can customize this however by using the `w` and `d` postfixes as
seen below:

| Literal | Encoding | Generated byte array                                                      |
|---------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `"AB"`  | UTF-8    | `[65, 66]`                                                                |
| `"AB"w` | UTF-16   | `[0, 65, 0, 66]` (BE) and `[65, 0, 66, 0]` (LE)                           |
| `"AB"d` | UTF-32   | `[0, 0, 0, 65, 0, 0, 0, 66]` (BE) and \`\[65, 0, 0, 0, 66, 0, 0, 0\] (LE) |

#### Concatenation

String literal concatenation allows two strings literals, at
compile-time, to be joined together to a *single* string literal. This
operation is done by placing the two literals next to one another as
follows:

``` d
ubyte* myName = "Tristan" " Velloza Kildaire";
```

The compiler will process this into a new *string expression* in the
form of “Tristan Velloza Kildaire”, therefore making it semantically the
same as if you had rather done:

``` d
ubyte* myName = "Tristan Velloza Kildaire";
```

If you combine two string literals of **different** encodings then the
string literal of the smaller (by bit-width) encoding scheme will be
up-converted to the greater (by bit-width) encoding scheme.
