## Configuration

The T compiler can have various variables tweaked to control the
behavior of the compiler

### `types`

Anything regarding the type system (this includes the type checker and
the meta processor).

1.  `types:max_width`
    - This entry holds an integral value
    - This sets the maximum bit-width of a machine (in bytes)
    - This can either be `1`, `2`, `4` or `8`
    - It affects how aliases such as `size_t` and `ssize_t` behave in
      terms of what the resolve to

### `dgen`

These options configure the C code emitter.

1.  `dgen:pretty_code`
    - This entry holds a boolean value
    - If `true` then the emitted code will be prettified, meaning it
      will be correctly indented. If `false` then no such prettifying
      will occur.
    - Default: `true`
2.  `dgen:mapper`
    - This entry holds a string value
    - This controls how symbol names within T are translated
    - The two available options are:
      1.  `"hashmapper"` - the hash of the T symbol name is the result
      2.  `"lebanese"` - all periods (`.`) within T symbols are replaced
          by underscores (`_`)
    - Default: `"hashmapper"`
3.  `dgen:emit_entrypoint_test`
    - This entry holds a boolean value
    - If `true` then instrumentation code will be added to the final
      output source code prior to compilation
    - Default: `true`
4.  `dgen:preinline_args`
    - This entry holds a boolean value
    - If `true` then the arguments (expressions) given to a function
      call will be placed in adhoc variables declared in order of
      appearance
    - These *variables* will be passed to the function call then
    - Default: `false` (TODO: change)
5.  `dgen:compiler`
    - This entry holds a string value
    - This is the path to the compiler executable that should be used to
      compile the generated C code
    - Default: `clang`

### `emit`

This controls aspects of the `CodeEmitter` API, meaning irrespective of
which emitter (such as `dgen`) is used.

TODO: Move `dgen_emit_entrypoint_test` and `dgen:pretty_code` here.

### `typecheck`

This controls the aspects of the `TypeChecker`.

1.  `typecheck:warnUnusedVars`
    - If this is set to `true` then at the end of the typechecking
      process a scan for all variables will be done and any variable
      that is unused will be printed out
    - Default: `true`

### `modman`

This controls various aspects of the module management system:

1.  `modman:strict_headers`
    - if this is set to `true` then it will enforce that every modulesâ€™
      declared name matches that of its filename *sans* the file
      extension
    - Default: `false`
