# First day of work

Basically finished the lexer today, it was the first day of
coding for the project so I am pleased with this progress.

On `#programming` on BNET:

```
[22:52:02] <~deavmi> no idea
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> Character literal support added
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> Now only escapes for cvharacter literals needed to be added
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> already added escapeiong support for string literals
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> The lexer is almost done
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> !
[23:39:48] <~deavmi> 🎊️🎊️🎊️🎊️🎊️
