Structures
==========

## Introduction

As we said in the introduction, we need to be able to create data structures for each entity of the program, eventually amounting in one super-structure of many smaller sub-strucrures (with their own children too) which represents the whole program's source code. This section will detail all of these structures and the common shared components alls structures have.
